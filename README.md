# Face the Facts
[Face The Facts](https://facethefacts.app/) is an open-source project that develops a mobile and web app to show politicians' information by scanning their election posters with a smartphone. Our mission is to make politicians' information (e.g., their past voting behaviours and CVs) more accessible and to encourage users to vote critically.
In our project, we focus on the German election system. With our architecture, you can build a Face The Facts app for a different country.
